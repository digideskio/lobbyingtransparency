    heading: GUIDING PRINCIPLES
    
    overview: |
        Lobbying is a legitimate activity and an important part of the democratic process.
    
    notes: |
        A democratic society is based on a pluralism of interests that holders of public office must navigate through in order to take reasoned decisions that favour the general good. In a healthy democracy, political representatives should be open to contact with their electorate, and citizens and interest groups should be able to communicate with administrative bodies; organise in associations and political parties; choose representatives in parliament; and generally participate in the political process. Lobbying enables those affected by public decisions to engage in the political process and also has the potential to enhance the quality of decision-making by providing channels for the input of valuable expertise. 

  -
    overview: |
        There is a significant public interest in ensuring the transparency and integrity of lobbying, as well as diversity of participation and contribution to public decision-making.
    
    notes: |
        Since lobbying is a part of the democratic process, it is important to ensure that there is diverse participation in public decision-making so that all viewpoints are taken into account. This should lead to better policy-making that favours the public interest.

        A key tool to ensuring a level playing field in the decision-making process is transparency. Lobbying, and the impact it has on legislation and policies, should be made transparent so that society at large can know who exercises influence and how. Indeed, transparency of lobbying permits any stakeholder in society to react to ongoing lobbying with their own efforts. Transparency also makes politicians aware that the public is watching, and allows citizens to evaluate the decision-making process with more precision and then to take this into account when voting in the next elections.
      
  -
    overview: |
        Any regulatory measures to secure these ends shall be proportionate, fit for purpose and not impede on the individual rights of assembly, free speech and petition of government.
    
    notes: |
        It is not the aim of lobbying regulation to simply burden a small segment of society, in particular lobbyists, with administrative obligations. Nor is it the aim to curtail the political rights of citizens. Lobbying regulation should be comprehensive enough to give citizens an accurate picture of how decisions are being taken and who is having an impact on legislation and policies, but it should not be instituted in such a way that it affects the rights of individual citizens, preventing them from gaining access to public decision-makers.

    heading: REGULATORY SCOPE
    
    overview: |
        The lobbying framework should clearly and unambiguously define what is lobbying and who is to be considered a lobbyist and lobbying target for the purposes of regulation.
    
    notes: |
        Defining lobbying and the lobbying target is the pivotal point of a regulation: without a definition, there are neither obligations nor rights for stakeholders. Experience with lobbying regulation shows that weak definitions are one of the main causes of loopholes. One word can decide, for example, whether in-house lobbyists are included or not, or whether a lobbyist can hide behind the activities of a non-profit organisation. The OECD has recommended that definitions of lobbying “be robust, comprehensive and sufficiently explicit to avoid misinterpretation and to prevent loopholes.” [^4]

    overview: |
        ### Definitions
        
        1. **‘Lobbying’** – the term should cover any direct or indirect communication with a public official that is made, managed or directed with the purpose of influencing public decision-making.
        
    notes: |
        A **lobbying** definition should address commonly known forms of lobbying, where a lobbyist enters into **direct** contact with a public official, but it should also cover **indirect** lobbying activities, for example, where lobbyists mobilise other stakeholders to represent their views or hire consultancy firms to do lobbying work on their behalf.

        The definition should cover “grassroots lobbying”, whereby a lobbyist asks a group of citizens or the general public to contact legislators and government officials and to lobby for their interest. However, the individual citizens would not be considered lobbyists (see the exceptions below). The terms “indirect” and “managed or directed” in the Standards refer to these types of activities, and this formulation is in line with Principle 4 of the OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying”.

  -
    overview: |
        2. **‘Public Official’**  – shall include any individual with decision-making powers (and their advisors), who are elected, appointed or employed within the executive or legislative branches of power at national, sub-national, or supra-national levels;  within private bodies performing public functions; and within public international organisations domiciled or operational in the country concerned.
        
    notes: |
        The definition of **public official** in these Standards is largely in line with the definition in international conventions (Article 2 lit. a United Nations Convention against Corruption). **Policy and legal advisors** should also be explicitly mentioned in order to ensure coverage of political staffs of members of parliaments, which are not considered as public officials in all jurisdictions.

        The term **executive branch** includes all public bodies, including independent institutions, such as anti-corruption commissions or general prosecutor offices.

        Public officials working in the **judicial branch**, including **judges** and their **legal experts** or aides, are covered by this definition insofar as they exercise administrative decision-making functions, but not when they are working on ongoing cases. Attempting to influence judges acting within judicial proceedings is explicitly prohibited by other laws with criminal sanctions and hence not covered by this definition.

        Increasingly **public functions are outsourced to private entities** that exercise administrative authority, perform public functions and/or receive substantial public funds. Due care should be taken to ensure they are covered by lobbying regulations.

        Decision makers on **regional or local levels** of the state should also be covered as they take decisions that are the target of lobbying activities and that have an impact on citizens' day-to-day lives.

        The same is true of **international organisations**, which should also be covered as they define and shape policies and legislation that their member states apply, so they should also be subject to the same levels of lobbying transparency.

  -
    overview: |
        3. **‘Lobbyist’** – should entail any natural or legal person who engages in lobbying activities, whether for private, public or collective ends, whether for compensation or without.
        
    notes: |
        The inclusion of lobbyists who do not work for **compensation** is in line with the OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying”, which call under Principle 4 for the inclusion of “**not-for-profit entities**, which aim to influence public decisions”. It also may be the case that an **honorary board member** receiving no compensation uses his or her clout to the advantage of the company or NGO they are affiliated with, so this must be covered by the definition.
        
        The definition of lobbyists should always include “**in-house**” lobbyists, those that work inside a particular organisation defending the interests of that company. Some lobby regulations, such as the one proposed in the UK, overlooks these lobbyists, focusing only on those working inside specific lobbying agencies. It hence leaves out a huge proportion of the lobby industry from the scope of the law.[^5] The definition should also include senior staff within companies or organisations (for example, a CEO of a corporation) for whom lobbying is not necessarily part of their job description, but who use their clout to gain access to government officials or influence public decisions.
        
        It should also be kept in mind that the private sector is not the only one that has lobbying interests; **public entities** such as local authorities or state owned companies often also have interests they would like to pursue towards the legislator or decision-maker. Indeed, **Member States** or **third countries** might want to influence the outcome of a decision taken by the EU, or by the OECD. We propose that this type of influence be captured and reported as part of the transparency of the decision-making process in general, rather than be covered by specific regulations on lobbying.
        
        It is worth highlighting the case of **lawyers** and their professional associations, which often try to fend off any lobbying regulation requirements by referring to the need to protect attorney-client privilege[^6]. However, this privilege only applies to legal advice and representation in formal legal procedures. Wherever lawyers do not represent a client’s legal interest in a concrete case towards executive or judicial officials, but political interests towards legislators in changing general legal rules or policies, lobbying regulations need to apply. Otherwise lawyers will have an unfair advantage vis-á-vis some clients who may prefer working with companies that are “regulation free”.
        
        > **Practical example:** A Texas lawyer managed to exonerate a prisoner client, but the client could not afford to pay the legal bill. The lawyer lobbied the state of Texas to raise the state's payment for unfairly imprisoned prisoners from US$50,000 per year to US$80,000 per year. His lobbying efforts were successful in making it possible for his client to pay the lawyer's fees. In this example, defending the client for wrongful imprisonment falls under legal representation, but the influence on the state legislator to raise the amount of compensation was technically lobbying.

  -
    overview: |
        4. **‘Public decision-making’** – shall include the creation and amendment of legislation or any other regulatory measures; the development, modification and implementation of public policies, strategies and programmes; and the awarding of government contracts or grants, administrative decisions or any other public spending decisions.
        
    notes: |
        Lobbying regulations sometimes focus only on parliamentary decisions[^7]. The Standards make it clear that such an approach is way too narrow: there are important public decisions also taken by the executive branch (including independent bodies), such as anti-trust decisions, financial market oversight approvals, or bail-out guarantees as well as rule-making processes at Agency and Ministry levels that have a significant impact on citizens' lives. On a regional/local level, it is obvious that for example, building permits[^8] can have a significant economic impact and thus would justify respective lobbying efforts, and hence regulation. 

        **International organisations** are probably the biggest gap in current regulations: the United Nations, the African Union, or the Council of Europe have not yet subjected lobbyists to any regulation. The European Union has adopted several measures to regulate lobbying: there is a lobby register (albeit still voluntary) and access to high-level decision-makers in the European Commission or to the premises of the European Parliament is forbidden to lobbyists that do not register. However, the EU could go further than it has done so far, as it has the ability to force the Member States to adopt lobby regulation in order to fulfil the Treaty objective of maintaining “open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society” and of giving “citizens and representative associations the opportunity to make known and publicly exchange their views in all areas of Union action.” Other international bodies could also enact lobby regulation similar to that currently in force at the EU level.

        There is a question about the extent to which international organisations (and indeed the supranational EU) can impose civil, administrative, or criminal sanctions on lobbyists. However, the countries making up the international organisations could impose lobby regulations that also cover lobbying towards inter-governmental bodies. In Ireland, for example, members of the European Parliament are covered by the national lobby legislation[^9].

    overview: |
        ###Exceptions
        
        5. Citizen interactions – the interaction of individual citizens with public officials concerning their private affairs shall not be considered lobbying, save for where it may concern individual economic interests of sufficient size or importance so as to potentially compromise public interest. In such case, a careful balancing act needs to be made on the respective benefit and efficacy of regulation, as well as due consideration given to any constitutional protections and guarantees.

    notes: |
        The exception for “**citizen interaction**” goes back to the third guiding principle of these Standards under which lobbying regulation should not impede on the individual rights of free speech and petition of government.

        When defining exceptions, care should be taken to ensure that they are applied narrowly. There are two reasons for this: First, there is no reason why small scale lobbyists should not fully comply with codes of conduct. Second, exceptions are risky in general, as they will be the first elements lobbyists will try to use as entry points for circumvention. We have not proposed an exception defined in terms of financial thresholds, number of employees, or time amount spent on lobbying because this creates loopholes, as the example of the USA's Lobbying Disclosure Act has shown[^10]. In addition, we reject the exception that, in some jurisdictions, applies to **experts** that are specifically **invited** to contribute to hearings. The reason for not exempting invited experts is that it can create loopholes for non-disclosure which could allow overly cosy relationships between public officials and private lobbyists to flourish. 

        The definition of lobbying in these Standards covers the action of attempting to influence a decision-making process. Hence, a citizen following up on an administrative procedure, for example to check whether or not their parking permit was received and/or approved, would not be covered by lobby regulations (we note that where there is an attempt to exercise influence, this should be covered by legislation on bribery or trafficking in influence).

        Where the individual is attempting to exercise influence on a decision-making process, a distinction should be made between **one-off or sporadic contacts** and regular attempts to influence these processes. Only those that regularly attempt to engage in a decision-making process should be required to register. This is because it is disproportionate and unnecessary to oblige every citizen that engages in sporadic lobbying activities to register.

        Due consideration should be given to whether particular individuals are so wealthy or influential that they might conceivably be able to influence a decision-making process even through a one-off contact. While this is difficult to regulate from the lobbyist’s side, due care should be taken to ensure the interactions of these individuals with decision-makers are covered by the public officials' obligation to be transparent. 

        However, the exception for citizens should be no entry point for abuse. Where the lobbying activities relate to an **individual's business interests** and where the action seeks to influence a decision-making process in its favour, the individual entrepreneur should be obliged to register (provided it is more than a one-off contact). The Austrian lobbying law clearly specifies that “entrepreneurial interests”[^11] of individual citizens are not to be exempted from the lobby regulation, for example.
        
        [^10]: Sect. 3 (10) Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (United States): “more than one lobbying contact, other than an individual whose lobbying activities constitute less than 20 percent of the time engaged in the services provided by such individual to that client over a six month period.” , [lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov](http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/index.html).

    overview: |
        6. Public officials, diplomats, political parties  – if deemed necessary, the regulation may exclude public officials acting in their official capacity, diplomatic agents of foreign states and political parties (since they play a quasi-public role).
        
    notes: |
        Exceptions for **public officials** and **diplomats** are a recurrent feature in lobbying regulations[^12]. In Austria[^13] and the United States[^14] **political parties** are also specifically exempted from lobbying legislation. This is because these public actors are an established part of the decision-making process. As such, they should be covered under the proactive and reactive transparency requirements that apply to public decision-making processes (see the section on “Public Access to Information” for more).
        
        [^12]: See for example the detailed list of exceptions in Section 3 (8) (B) Lobbying Disclosure Act of 1995 (United States), [lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov](http://lobbyingdisclosure.house.gov/index.html).

    heading: TRANSPARENCY
    
    overview: |
        The lobbying interactions between lobbyists and public officials shall be transparent, increasing awareness on the operation of government, contributing to stakeholder participation and allowing for public confidence and oversight. The responsibility for transparency should be shared by the lobbyists and the public official, but it is public officials who must be accountable to the public for decisions taken.
        
    notes: |
        Transparency is the **key objective** of the at least 20 lobbying regulations that are known worldwide: there are regulations which aim only at transparency[^15], but there is no regulation that does not include transparency. Furthermore, transparency is one of the two main pillars of the OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” (alongside Integrity), and the “International Lobbying Disclosure Guidelines” by the Sunlight Foundation focus only on transparency[^16], as does Access info's Briefing on Lobbying Transparency via the Right of Access to Information[^17].

    overview: |
        ### Lobbying Register
        
        7. Mandatory register – the framework should require the establishment of a mandatory lobbying register to which the lobbyists, and all organisations who lobby whether by employing in-house or other lobbyists, must sign up in order to conduct their lobbying activities, and within which such activities are to be reported on a periodic basis along with any designated supplementary information.
        
    notes: |
         **Mandatory registers** are the uniform standard in national lobbying legislations. They usually require the parallel sign up of several lobbyists: the legal entity that is lobbying is responsible for making a declaration in the lobby register, in which they must list these natural people working for them as lobbyists, as well as the lobbying client where applicable. Lobby clients are usually also required to register, and to likewise declare who they are hiring to act on their behalf. Many national lobbying legislations make registration a condition for lobbying or for obtaining access to key decision-makers. Some regulations go even further and require certain qualifications for conducting lobbying activities.[^18] However, this is problematic as it creates a danger that ordinary citizens, small businesses or civil society groups would be prevented from accessing decision-makers, which runs counter to these standards.
         
         [^18]: Law on Lobbying (Montenegro), Chapter III, [antikorupcija.me/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&view=category&id=27:&Itemid=195](http://antikorupcija.me/index.php?option=com_phocadownload&view=category&id=27:&Itemid=195) (unofficial translation from Montenegrin).
        
  - 
    overview: |
        
        8. Timely registration and reporting – the initial lobbyist registration should take place in a timely fashion, before any lobbying activity takes place. Information should be updated shortly after any relevant changes occur. The frequency of activity reporting should be set with the aim of allowing for the meaningful analysis and intervention from other parties (minimum quarterly, ideally close to real-time).
        
    notes: |
        Timely registration and reporting aims at equality of arms between different interest groups: The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” make clear that the public should have “timely access to such information [about lobbying]” in order to allow for “the inclusion of diverse views of society and business to provide balanced information in the development and implementation of public decisions”.

        The frequency of reporting should be designed to allow other interest groups or the public at large to react to lobbying information before final decisions are taken. In Canada, for example, lobbyists are obliged to file monthly returns in which they must report the name of the designated public office holder who was the object of a communication, the date of these communications, and the subject-matter of the communication.
        
  - 
    overview: |
        9. Information disclosed – among others, the register shall include information on:
        
            1. lobbyist identity
            2. the subject matter of lobbying activities and outcomes sought
            3. the ultimate beneficiary of lobbying activities (where relevant)
            4. the targeted institution and/or the public official concerned
            5. the type and frequency of lobbying activities
            6. any supporting documentation shared with the public officials
            7. lobbying expenditure, including in-kind (calculated to set criteria, in cost bands, if need be)
            8. sources of funding, per client and per dossier
            9. any political contributions, including in-kind
            10. any prior roles as public official held by the individual and/or family members
            11. public funding received
        
    notes: |
        1. This should include the name and surname of the natural person engaged in lobbying. At the time of registration, lobbyists should provide consent that their names will be accessible via the register.
        2. This is to ensure that citizens know what decisions lobbyists are trying to impact upon and how.
        3. Members of the public should be able to know who exactly is seeking to have an impact upon a particular decision. This also prevents “astroturfing”, which is when large lobby groups set up smaller organisations or citizens' petitions to defend their interests, making them look like grassroots efforts (“astroturfing” is a play on words for a fake version of “grassroots”).
        4. This is to ensure the impartiality and accountability of public officials and institutions involved in decision-making.
        5. This should lay out the various methods used: public events, press statements, websites, coalitions, agenda-setting activities, research, etc., so that the public can get a real idea of how attempts to influence public decision-making function.
        6. Disclosure of position papers, research reports etc. which are used to support lobbying efforts, allows the general public to see what arguments are being presented and for other counter-interests to organise and also participate in the decision-making process.
        7. There may always be inequality of means but this should not result in inequality of access and impact on decision-making. To ensure that this is the case, transparency over lobby expenditure is essential.
        8. This is mostly relevant for lobby consultancy firms and law firms that provide lobby services, and it is necessary to ensure that lobby clients are subject to the same levels of transparency as those that do not hire third parties.
        9. Notwithstanding specific legislation on political contributions, measures like this would work to prevent “cash for access” or “cash for influence” scandals, actions which are clearly prohibited under international standards and by political finance laws throughout Europe.
        10. This is to ensure transparency over potential conflicts of interest or instances of inequality of access to decision-makers that could result from the revolving door (when public officials move from regulatory jobs to work for a private firm in the same sector that he or she previously regulated – see the section on Integrity below for more).
        11. This is to ensure transparency and accountability in the spending of public funds, and it allows citizens to assess whether or not there is a level playing field.
        
  - 
    overview: |
        10. Accessibility, openness and comparability of data – the information should be made available online, through a single website, free of charge, indexable and downloadable in full as machine readable open data (as per [opendefinition.org](http://opendefinition.org/)). As far as possible, this data should conform to existing open data standards. A unique identifier shall be assigned to each lobbyist and organisation registered. Linking the information to other data sets, including those arising from proactive government disclosure, is highly recommended.
        
    notes: |
        Publishing the information in open formats allows for advocacy groups, journalists and members of the public to download, search through and analyse the data, without the need to pay for proprietary software. This in turn ensures that there is wider public dissemination of the information and that the data is more digestible for citizens and decision-makers alike.

        The United States Senate Lobbying Disclosure Database is an example allowing for advanced searches by combining several search criteria[^19]. In addition, the Canadian lobbying register provides for an extraction of the whole set of registered data[^20]. Civil society organisations already make use of the data that is available: for example, the Sunlight Foundation has launched an online “influence explorer”, which “lets users explore how foreign entities influence policy and public opinion in the U.S.”[^21] “OpenSecrets” publishes a database showing lobbing expenditures in the United States: users can search by name for a company, lobbying firm or individual lobbyist; search for the total spending by a particular industry; view the interests that lobbied a particular government agency; or search for lobbying on a general issue or specific piece of legislation.[^22]

    overview: |
        11. Minimal administrative burden – the system should allow for ease of registration and reporting, and look to minimise the administrative burden involved. The public sector obligations in terms of proactive disclosure and the public right to know should factor in achieving the right balance of mutual duties for lobbying transparency.
        
    notes: |
        Registration should be quick and simple to do, preferably online and ideally using one single system for registration, reporting and publication. It is important to remember that public officials are obliged to respect the right of access to information, so the burden should be placed on them to also be transparent about lobbying and the impact it has on the decision-making process.
        
  - 
    overview: |
        ### Public Access to Information
        
        12. Access to information law – a comprehensive access to information law shall guarantee the public’s right of access to information, including information about lobbying. 
        
    notes: |
        Public bodies are obliged to fulfil and respect the fundamental right of access to information, and to ensure that their decision-making processes are transparent and accessible. Public officials should be accountable for the decisions that they take and for the impact that lobbyists have on the decision-making process.

        The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” contain a reminder that “freedom of information legislation” is one of the prerequisites to “support a culture of transparency and integrity in lobbying”. 

        These standards do not cover the influence that other public bodies such as Ministries, Advisory Bodies, third countries or even International Institutions might have on national decision-making processes, as it is understood that, as public actors, their accountability would be achieved through proactive and reactive government disclosure under specific access to information laws.

        13. Limited exceptions – the law should clearly set out a limited number of exceptions to address the privacy, security, financial sensitivity, decision-making process and any other legitimate concerns, which should be bound by a harm and public interest test applied in line with internationally accepted standards.
        
    notes: |
        The right of access to information is not an absolute right and there are certain legitimate interests that could be harmed as a result of publication of some pieces of information. The Council of Europe Convention is the first international treaty on access to documents and, although it is not yet in force, it is widely seen as the standard for defining which freedom of information exceptions are legitimate and which are not. Exceptions to the right of access to information should be covered by a harm test (so that the exception only applies if actual harm might arise from publication), and by a public interest test (so that, where harm might well occur but there is an overriding public interest in the information, it should be published anyway).[^24]

        As the General Court of the European Court of Justice has made clear, “if citizens are to be able to exercise their democratic rights, they must be in a position to follow in detail the decision-making process [...] and to have access to all relevant information.”[^25]

        14. Proactive publication – the public bodies and officials should proactively publish their organisational, programmatic, administrative, financial, and business schedule information, summaries of meetings and other interactions with third parties, as well as any background documentation and preparatory analyses received or commissioned in the course of their work. These obligations shall also extend to the operation of any expert and consultative bodies convened by the public sector.
        
    notes: |
        **Proactive publication** of information is an intrinsic part of the right of access to information. A recent paper by the World Bank points out that “proactive disclosure is integral to the transparency that underpins good government [...]. The precise standards for what information should be proactively disclosed are still being defined, but it is possible to identify common classes of information which should form the minimum of any national access to information regime.”[^26] In the context of lobbying, these Standards define the minimum that is necessary to monitor lobbying influences in the records of state bodies, including schedules, agendas, or meeting notes. For more information on which information about lobbying should be published proactively and which in response to access to information requests, see Access Info Europe's Lobby Transparency via the Right of Access to Information Laws briefing: [www.access-info.org/pub-and-toolkits/17237](http://www.access-info.org/pub-and-toolkits/17237)

        15. Decision-making footprint – where possible, and certainly for all legislative and policy initiatives, this information should be clustered around the individual items for consideration, producing a ‘decision-making footprint’, outlining the history, public engagement and overall process for the initiative. The footprint should also link to the lobbying register data.
        
    notes: |
        The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” call on governments to “consider facilitating public scrutiny by indicating who has sought to influence legislative or policy-making processes, for example by disclosing a “legislative footprint” that indicates the lobbyists consulted in the development of legislative initiatives.” This principle of transparency should apply to executive decision-making processes as well.
        
        In 2011, the European Parliament adopted a proposal to create a “legislative footprint annex” to reports drafted by Members of the Parliament. This annex would list all the lobbyists whom lead MEPs met while a legislative report was being drafted, albeit on a voluntary basis.[^27] 

        To read more about what a legislative footprint should look like, see the briefing created for the EU institutions by the EU Office of Transparency International.[^28]

        16. Clear, Free and Comprehensive – all information must be made public without charge (excluding actual costs on delivery) and without limits to reuse. Any key information and analysis should be presented in a form that is accessible and comprehensible to both citizens and interest groups. All recently generated data proactively released shall be published as machine readable open data.
        
    notes: |
        International Standards on the right of access to information make clear that public data should be provided for free, unless costs for the actual reproduction of the data need to be recovered (such as printing or photocopying costs). 

        Restrictions on re-use of public information are, in effect, a limitation also on the right to freedom of expression, and hence they should only be applied to public data where strictly necessary.

        The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” state that “The public has a right to know how public institutions and public officials made their decisions, including, where appropriate, who lobbied on relevant issues. Countries should consider using information and communication technologies, such as the Internet, to make information accessible to the public in a cost-effective manner.” 

        There are several open data standards that could be used to ensure that lobbying information is published in a machine-readable format, which allows for more efficient processing and analysis of public information – the European Commission and OECD have published some guidelines on this.[^29]

    heading: INTEGRITY
    
    overview: |
        Both lobbyists and public officials should be subject to clear and enforceable standards of conduct and a system for managing conflicts of interest. The onus for proper behaviour shall sit with both parties; however the public officials shall have heightened responsibilities given their role as the holders of entrusted power.
        
    notes: |
        Alongside transparency, integrity is the other fundamental pillar of lobbying regulation. The integrity principles for public officials contained in these Standards are based on **international standards**, in particular the Council of Europe “Model Code of Conduct for Public Officials” (2001).[^30]

        The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” also aim at “fostering a culture of integrity” (main principle III) by requiring ethical rules for lobbyists and public officials. 

        The “Handbook on parliamentary ethics and conduct, a guide for parliamentarians,” by the “Global Organization of Parliamentarians Against Corruption (GOPAC)” provides further instructions on ethics regulation.[^31]

        The Group of States against Corruption (GRECO) Evaluation Reports, 4th Round, tend to include the issue of lobbying when assessing the integrity of parliamentarians.[^32] Integrity rules are necessary for both **lobbyists** and **public officials**, and they should complement each other.

    overview: |
        ### Public Officials
        
        17. Codes of Conduct – all public officials shall have an applicable set of rules laying out the key standards of conduct, including for their dealings with third parties. Such rules may be institution dependent, but should include:
        
            1. Key behavioural principles including those of transparency, integrity, responsiveness, impartiality, fairness, accountability and serving the public interest
            2. The duty to keep a true and detailed record of their actions, including of meetings with lobbyists
            3. The duty to avoid lobbying contacts with unregistered lobbyists, and to report any violations of the lobbying rules to their superiors or relevant bodies
            4. The duty of confidentiality, subject to the public access to information regime
            5. A comprehensive mechanism for dealing with any real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest, including the incompatibilities of being a lobbyist
            6. A comprehensive guidance for dealing with gifts and hospitality, including their registration or decline
            7. A system for assets and interests disclosure by the public official, as well as by their family and business partners depending on the scope of the decision-making power of the official.
        
    notes: |
        1. These are standard principles that apply to all public officials. For example, the OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” list inter alia the following duties of public officials: “impartiality to promote the public interest, disclose relevant private interests and avoid conflict of interest” (Principle 7).
        2. This ensures that there is transparency of the decision-making process and of the impact of lobbying efforts on the final outcome. The Peruvian law on lobbying specifically includes a record-keeping obligation, for example.[^33] The European Commission has likewise adopted decisions that require Directors General, Commissioners and their cabinets to keep a record (public list) of their meetings with interest representatives.
        3. In Montenegro, the law on lobbying specifically obliges public officials to report lobbying **violations**[^34]. Australia is also one of the many countries in which there is a prohibition on contacts with unregistered lobbyists[^35]. European Union Commissioners, Directors-General and their cabinets are likewise prohibited from meeting with unregistered lobbyists.
        4. The principle of **confidentiality** is not meant to run counter to freedom of information, but applies only in cases where there are exceptions to freedom of information that cover particularly sensitive information. Codes of conduct often make reference to post-employment confidentiality requirements.  The objective is to mitigate the risk of a former public official using their insider knowledge, for example from working in a financial oversight body, when they move to the private sector to lobby for the interests of banks.[^36] Cooling-off periods can mitigate but not prevent such abuse.
        5. There are many national lobbying regulations that highlight the **incompatibility** of being a public official and a lobbyist at the same time, for example in Austria,[^37] Macedonia,[^38] or Montenegro. This is due to the fact that public officials are mandated to act in the public interest, which requires impartiality. Hence public office is incompatible with the role of a lobbyist, as they work to defend the interests of a particular sector of society.
        6. The following quote illustrates how important robust rules in particular on **gifts** are. The famous North-American lobbyist Jack Abramoff said in a TV interview that “very few members” of Congress do not accept some form of bribery: “I am talking about giving a gift to somebody who makes a decision on behalf of the public and at the end of the day that’s really what bribery is [...]. But it’s done every day and it’s still being done.”[^39]

            A 2014 report by the European Parliament demonstrates the seriousness of the problem: the report calls for an amendment of the Code of Conduct for lobbyists in order to prohibit “interference in the private sphere or personal life of decision-makers, e.g. by sending gifts to a decision-maker’s home address”.[^40]

            As for executive public officials, Article 18 of the Council of Europe “Model Code of Conduct for Public Officials” prohibits public officials to “demand or accept gifts, favours, hospitality or any other benefit [...] which may influence or appear to influence the impartiality with which he or she carries out his or her duties or may be or appear to be a reward relating to his or her duties. This does not include conventional hospitality or minor gifts.” 

            It should be noted that for example in Peru, there is an **absolute ban** to accept any generosity by lobbyists.[^41] In Argentina, there is a direct ban on gifts directly related to the MP’s position. In Australia MPs are allowed to accept gifts, but only if they do not present a direct conflict of interest.”[^42]
            
        7. **Asset declarations** are relevant in the context of lobbying in several ways: they can show how public officials might have second jobs incompatible with their main position (for example as lobbyists), as well as previous positions or involvements with interests in conflict with the public interest they are supposed to defend. From a financial side the declarations can also show any significant financial influence on the public official.

            International standards are the Organisation of American States (OAS) “Model law on the declaration of interests, income, assets and liabilities of persons performing public functions” (2013)[^43] and the “Western Balkan Recommendation on Disclosure of Finances and Interests by Public Officials” (2014).[^44]

    overview: |
        
        18. Post-employment restrictions – there should be a proportionate moratoria (or ‘cooling-off periods’) of at least 2 years before former public officials can lobby their former institutions concerning their prior duties. Approval from a designated ethics agency may be required before the public official can take up such a position.
        
    notes: |
        The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” call in this context to avoid post-public service ‘switching sides’ in specific processes and using their insider knowledge of the process to the benefit of their new, private sector, employer. It may be necessary to impose a ‘cooling-off’ period that restricts former public officials from lobbying their past organisations, should a risk of a conflict of interest arise. As for cooling-off periods, it should be noted that some countries apply longer periods of up to three or five years, such as Canada[^54] or Taiwan.[^55]
        
        [^54]: Section 10.11 Lobbying Act (Canada): “No individual shall, during a period of five years after the day on which the individual ceases to be a designated public office holder carry on” lobbying activities; [www.ocl-cal.gc.ca/eic/site/012.nsf/eng/h_00008.html](http://www.ocl-cal.gc.ca/eic/site/012.nsf/eng/h_00008.html).
        [^55]: Article 10 Lobbying Act (Taiwan): Public officials “shall not lobby [...] on behalf of legal persons or organizations in three years after leaving office”, [www.tychakka.gov.tw/hakka2012/intro/sheet/upt.asp?pageno=1&uid=&con=&cid=&year=&month=&day=&key=&p0=19](http://www.tychakka.gov.tw/hakka2012/intro/sheet/upt.asp?pageno=1&uid=&con=&cid=&year=&month=&day=&key=&p0=19).

    overview: |
        
        19. Pre-employment restrictions – prospective public officials, excluding those elected into office, but particularly those hired or seconded into advisory and regulatory roles, shall be subject to a conflicts of interest vetting process that may necessitate their recusal or supervision for certain aspects of their activities, or a disqualification from the potential position. Omission to declare details that may be relevant for identifying potential conflicts of interests should trigger disciplinary procedures.
        
    notes: |
        Conflicts of interest might arise if a public official previously worked in the private sector and if they enter policy or advisory jobs in which their previous position could have an adverse impact. The OECD has recommended that “countries may consider a similar temporary cooling-off period restriction on appointing or hiring a lobbyist to fill a regulatory or an advisory post” for this reason.
        
        > **Practical example:** A campaigner for a child-rights NGO might find a new job in the EU institutions, specifically in the unit that takes decisions on funding applications for grants to NGOs. The campaigner should avoid taking decisions on grants relating to their previous employer, to prevent risks that a conflict of interest may arise, and to prevent the public perception that there is a risk of a conflict of interest as well.

        ### Lobbyists
        
        20. Statutory code of conduct – there should be a statutory code of conduct for lobbyists developed in close consultation with all stakeholders and interested parties.
        
    notes: |
        Most lobbying regulations refer to ethical principles for lobbyists, which regulate their contact with decision-makers, but in most jurisdictions, these principles are not elevated to a statutory code of conduct. Austria and Canada are exceptions. In Canada, for example, all lobbyists are required to comply with a Lobbyists’ Code of Conduct and the Commissioner of Lobbying has the authority to administer and enforce the code if there is an alleged breach of either a principle or a rule of the Code.[^56]

        21. Behavioural standards – the code shall lay out the core behavioural standards, particularly with regards to honesty and the avoidance of undue influence.
        
    notes: |
        The obligation on lobbyists to act with **honesty** is an important part of most codes of conduct on lobbying. Lobbyists are obliged to disclose to public officials at first encounter that they are working for a client and to name that client. In many cases lobbyists are also prohibited from submitting false or manipulated data to the public official in order to strengthen their cause.

        Lobbyists are also prohibited from encouraging public officials to exercise undue influence, for example by offering financial or immaterial advantages to public officials in exchange for a favourable decision (see the section on public officials and gifts, above). 

        There are a wide variety of behavioural standards in national codes of conduct for lobbyists: obligations include to refrain from disguising clients, referring to non-existent clients, or providing false information on the nature of the lobbying assignment (Australia, Lithuania); to refrain to use the logo of the lobbied public institution (France); to refrain from agreeing on success fees (Austria); or to refrain from financial contributions in exchange for opportunities to speak at events in Parliament (France).

    overview: |
        
        22. Self-regulation – supplementary measures shall be taken to encourage lobbyists to voluntarily adopt, publicise and report on additional ethical commitments, including through collective action. Such commitments shall be backed by internal control and sanction mechanisms, and be integrated within their broader corporate social responsibility (CSR) and governance strategy.
        
    notes: |
        This is a reflection of the OECD’s Principle 9: “Countries should involve key actors in implementing a coherent spectrum of strategies and practices to achieve compliance.”

        In Austria, for example, the lobby law encourages lobbyists to adopt their own codes of conduct: Lobbyists “have to base their lobbying on a code of conduct, and have to refer to it on their webpage.”[^57] For more information on self-regulation you could refer to the “Woodstock Principles for the Ethical Conduct of Lobbying”[^58] or the “Society of European Affairs Professionals Code of Conduct”.[^59]

        The Global Compact’s report “Towards Responsible Lobbying” provides guidance on responsible lobbying for businesses; the report includes topics such as “Mapping the People Involved in Lobbying Activities”, “Ensuring Robust Management of Lobbying Activities”, “Reporting on Influence”, as well as providing “Examples of Lobbying Codes of Conduct”.[^60]
        
        > **Practical example:** The EU Office of Transparency International adopted an internal policy in 2015 whereby they have started to publish a list containing “Meetings between staff members of Transparency International EU and MEPs, Commissioners and other officials who are involved in the policy-making process.” They report “all meetings and contacts with EU officials where we have sought to influence the policy-making process.”

    heading: PARTICIPATION & ACCESS
    
    overview: |
        Both pressure groups and the public at large should enjoy an open and fair access to public decision-making, allowing for a diversity of input, better policies, and ultimately more representative and trusted democracy.
        
    notes: |
        Lobbying regulations aim to ensure that there is transparency of influence and hence a level playing field for all stakeholders to have the same opportunities to access and influence public decision makers. However, transparency over who has access is not the same as specific measures to ensure **access for all**. For this reason, citizens and other segments of society such as small and medium enterprises should be provided with specific channels and opportunities to participate in public decision making in a meaningful way.
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        ### Public Participation in Decision-making
        
        23. Right to participate – there should be a generally recognised right for all groups and public at large to participate in public decision-making, extending in particular to legislative and policy matters, within all levels of governance.
        
    notes: |
        The right to participate is a fundamental part of democracy, and citizens should be able to have an impact on ongoing decision-making processes as well as voting in regular elections.

        The right to participate in the making of policies and laws at the level of the European Union and its Member States is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty, which states that “Every citizen shall have the right to participate in the democratic life of the Union. Decisions shall be taken as openly and as closely as possible to the citizen”.
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        24. Public consultation process – a legal framework should lay out in a law or a group of laws the varied means for public participation in the formulation, implementation, and evaluation of policies and laws, including timeframes and specific mechanisms to disseminate public meeting information, attendance and participation rules, instruments and tools to submit comments and opinion on specific policies.
        
    notes: |
        A legal framework should clearly and precisely lay out the participation rights that citizens have and how these can be exercised. Government bodies should make an active effort to promote public consultations via various communications channels – official bulletins but also traditional and social media - in order to reach as many members of the public as possible.
        
        > **Practical example:** In Finland, the Government Project Register (HARE) provides “up-to-date information on ongoing legislative proposals. On the website, citizens, organisations and other stakeholders can subscribe to press releases by e-mail regarding the progress of specific legislative projects as well as give feedback on the projects.”
        
        There may be some cases in which public participation in a particular process is not practicable because of time-constraints, but this should not be the norm and any derogations from the right to participation should be clearly defined in advance and very strictly applied.
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        25. Equal opportunity – there shall be an obligation on public authorities to provide an equal opportunity for participation to various interest groups and the public at large. 
        
    notes: |
         Public officials should be required to ensure that they are consulting with a balanced set of interests and they should make efforts to gather input from sectors that are traditionally under-represented. 
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        26. Timely and effective contribution – the public authorities should be obliged to provide an adequate time period for consultation allowing sufficient time for review of the preparatory materials under discussion, and should strive to promote effective participation at the appropriate stage, while decisions are still open.
        
    notes: |
         In order to ensure participation in decision-making, **transparency** of the drafting process is essential from the **beginning** and not just at the much later parliamentary stage. A typical negative example of public participation is the still prevalent practice of publishing a draft law only once it is submitted to parliament, and for information only, but without any feedback mechanism for the public at large.[^61] The UK Cabinet Office has recommended that public consultations be open for at least 12 weeks (see below for more). The European Commission also has a minimum 12-week window for public consultations.
         
         [^61]: This paragraph draws largely from: Tilman Hoppe, Anti-Corruption Assessment of Laws (“Corruption Proofing”), RCC/RAI publishing 2015, Chapter 2.1.2, pages 33 following, [www.stt.lt/documents/soc_tyrimai/Comparative_Study-Methodology_on_Anti-corruption_Assessment_of_Laws_14_11_17.pdf](http://www.stt.lt/documents/soc_tyrimai/Comparative_Study-Methodology_on_Anti-corruption_Assessment_of_Laws_14_11_17.pdf). 
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        27. Publication of results – the (written and verbal) views of participants in the consultation process shall be made public, and the authorities should outline how the various views have been taken into account and why.
        
    notes: |
        There should be transparency and accountability over how decisions were taken and which inputs had an impact on the final outcome. Input that is not taken into account should likewise be specified. This allows for the identification of any potentially disproportionate influence on the decision-making process. 
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        28. Refusals of the right – the public authorities shall provide a written justification for any refusal of the right to participate, and those excluded shall have options available to challenge and contest that exclusion in a procedure that is expeditious enough to provide for participation in case the refusal is overturned.
        
    notes: |
         Refusals of the right to participate should be duly motivated, proportionate and necessary. Those denied the right to participate should be able to challenge such restrictions.

        ####WANT TO KNOW MORE?
        
        In terms of good practice guidelines for public consultation, the OECD has identified the revised “Code of Practice on Consultation”[^62] in the United Kingdom as an example to be followed.[^63] It contains the following seven principles:[^64]
        
        - **When** to consult: Formal consultation should take place at a stage when there is scope to influence the policy outcome.
        - **Duration** of the consultation exercise: Consultations should normally last for at least 12 weeks with consideration given to longer timescales where feasible and sensible.
        - **Clarity** of scope and impact: Consultation documents should be clear about the consultation process, what is being proposed, the scope to influence and the expected cost and benefit of the proposals.
        - **Accessibility** of consultation exercises: Consultation exercises should be designed to be accessible to and clearly targeted at those people the exercise is intended to reach.
        - **The burden** of consultation: Keeping the burden of consultation to a minimum is essential if consultations are to be effective and if consultee buy-in to the process is to be obtained.
        - **Responsiveness** of consultation exercises: Consultation responses should be analysed carefully and clear feedback provided to participants following the consultation.
        - **Capacity** to consult: Officials running consultations should seek guidance on how to run an effective consultation exercise and share what they have learned from the experience.
        
        A White Paper of 2001 on “European Governance” by the European Commission aimed to reinforce the culture of consultation and dialogue at the EU level and thus increase the legitimacy of the decisions. It emphasises the importance of providing clear consultation documents, consulting all relevant target groups, leaving sufficient time for participation, and publishing results and providing feedback.[^65]

        There are further international standards and comparative publications on public participation such as those created by the European Institute of Public Participation (EIPP). Also relevant is the “Comparative Overview of European Standards and Practices in Regulating Public Participation”.[^66]

        ### Expert/Advisory Groups
        
        29. Balanced composition – there should be a legal obligation on public authorities to strive for a balanced composition of expert and advisory bodies, representing a diversity of interests and views.
        
    notes: |
        Expert input is often essential in public decision making. Decision makers will not always fully understand themselves highly technical issues such as financial market regulation or bio-technology, and so they rely to a large extent on **external experts**. Public bodies should also be required to make transparent the parameters, functioning and policy documents considered by the expert groups.[^67]
        
        In parliament, a diversity of experts is usually ensured by internal rules giving all political factions a say in the nomination of experts for formal hearings. With expert and advisory groups for executive or independent bodies, the nomination of their members is often not so clear. Often, such bodies are installed **informally** and on an ad-hoc basis.
        
        However, in some cases, the procedures for selecting external experts are highly formalised, such as the “European Economic and Social Committee”, a consultative body of the European Union stipulated in the Union’s treaties.  Some international organisations such as the World Health Organisation also have explicit general rules on how advisory bodies should be set up.[^68]
        
        [^67]: See for example [www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees](http://www.fda.gov/AdvisoryCommittees/), which publishes the following information: “About Advisory Committees: How to become a member of an advisory committee, common questions, and the laws, regulations, and guidances that govern the committees; Committees & Meeting Materials: Committee information, charter, meeting materials, committee roster, etc; Advisory Committee Calendar: Confirmed and Tentatively Scheduled Meetings; Recently Updated Advisory Committee Materials: Meeting announcements, briefing materials, requests for nominations, and other important information”.

        30. Disclosure of interests – advisory and expert group members shall be required to disclose their interests and affiliations relevant to items under consideration in advance of any work on the issue.
        
    notes: |
        An example for the **disclosure** of interests is the European Union’s “standard Commission decision setting up an expert group”.[^69] Article 4 no. 8 states: “The names of individuals representing an interest shall be published in the Register; /the interest represented shall be disclosed”; Article 11 requires: “at the start of each meeting, any expert whose participation in the group’s work would raise a conflict of interest” to “inform the Chair”.

        ### Lobbyist incentives
        
        31. Lobbyist incentives – any lobbyist incentives should be considered with care, so as not to entrench special privilege of organised interests over those of individual citizens.
        
    notes: |
        Some countries provide incentives to lobbyists, such as access cards, invitations, or privileged access to meetings: “A lobbyist entered in the register of lobbyists in the Republic of Slovenia shall have the right to be invited to all public presentations and all forms of public consultations with regard to the areas in which he has registered an interest, and shall be informed thereof by the State bodies and local communities.”[^70] However, such provisions raise the constitutional question of **equal treatment**: In principle, citizens should have the same rights as lobbyists, for example they should be able to receive notifications of public consultations in their fields of interests.

    heading: OVERSIGHT, MANAGEMENT AND SANCTIONS
    
    overview: |
        There should be sufficient oversight and support for the operation of lobbying regulations, as well as effective sanctions for cases of violation
        
    notes: |
        Oversight and sanctions are a standard feature of any integrity regulation. To this end, the OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” also call for lobbying regulations to provide for “Mechanisms for effective implementation, compliance and review” in its main Principle IV.
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        32. Management & Investigation – an independent, mandated and well-resourced oversight body or coordinated mechanism should be charged with:
            1. managing lobbying registration
            1. reviewing potential conflicts of interest
            1. collating and disseminating the locations of proactively disclosed information
            1. monitoring compliance (including pro-active verification and spot-audits of reports)
            1. following up on complaints
            1. investigating apparent breaches and anomalies
            1. consulting on and defining further regulatory provisions where there is a mandate
        
    notes: |
        An **oversight body** is a standard feature of any lobbying regulation. Independence in this context means that the oversight body is not identical with the parliament or ministries it needs to monitor. It should have an independent budget and merit-based appointments. Examples are the “Standards in Public Office Commission” (Ireland),[^71] the “Chief Official Ethics Commission” (Lithuania),[^72] or the “Agency for Prevention of Corruption” (Montenegro).

        The **management** and **investigation** function of the oversight body is important, as many laws contain only a general implementation clause, which in practice leads the competent authority to maintain the register and otherwise passively wait for complaints, as is the case in the European Union, for example.[^73] Canada is a positive example of a lobby regulation that contains a comprehensive provision on investigations and how they should be conducted.[^74]

  -
    overview: |
        
        33. Advice, analysis and awareness raising – this body or mechanism should also offer guidance and training to lobbyists and public officials on the application of relevant laws, analyse trends and report on their findings, raise awareness among the public and the profession on recent developments; and promote best practice in the sector.
        
    notes: |
         The function to provide **guidance** and **public awareness** is sometimes explicitly foreseen in national regulations. This is the case in Ireland, for example.[^75] It helps to ensure compliance with the law.
         
         [^75]: Section 17 Regulation of Lobbying Act 2015 (Ireland): “(1) The Commission may issue guidance about the operation of this Act and may from time to time revise it or re-issue it. (2) The Commission shall publish the guidance in such manner and form as the Commission considers appropriate. (3) The Commission may make available information with a view to promoting awareness and understanding of this Act.”, [www.per.gov.ie/regulation-of-lobbying](http://www.per.gov.ie/regulation-of-lobbying/).
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        34. Complaint mechanism – there should be a well-publicised complaint mechanism that allows anyone to report violations either openly, confidentially or anonymously and to be informed on the specific outcome of the complaint, subject to any privacy limitations.
        
    notes: |
         It is important to point out that according to the UNCAC, the “relevant anti-corruption bodies [...] shall provide access [...] for the reporting, including anonymously, of any incidents”. In practice, many successful corruption investigations go back to anonymous complaints and it is fair to say that they would not have been possible had **anonymous complaints** not been admissible.
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        35. Sanctions – lobbyists and public officials shall be subject to effective, proportionate and dissuasive sanctions for the violation of lobbying rules. These sanctions should have a sliding scale, including the threat of criminal sanctions, (temporary) de-registration, and disciplinary proceedings for public officials. Those sanctioned may have their name and employer information published. Public sector contracts concluded in violation of essential regulations could be deemed null and void where appropriate. Personal liability should attach to the leadership of organisations where they are found to have consented to or connived in the commission of the offence. 
        
    notes: |
        **Sanctions** in national regulations range from reminders and temporary disbarments[^76] to criminal sanctions, including prison terms of up to five years.[^77] It is important to define liability in a way that it does not only cover lobbyists in a technical sense, but for example also a senior manager of an organisation who is responsible for ensuring that the legal person complies with lobbying regulations, even they do not lobby personally.

    heading: REGULATORY FRAMEWORK DESIGN
    
    overview: |
        Lobbying regulations should take into account the local context, and be aligned with the broader regulatory and policy framework in place. 
        
    notes: |
        The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” state in this context: “Rules and guidelines on lobbying should address the governance concerns related to lobbying practices, and respect the socio-political and administrative contexts. [...]

        The OECD’s “10 Principles for Transparency and Integrity in Lobbying” also call on countries to “take into account how the regulatory and policy framework already in place can support a culture of transparency and integrity in lobbying. This includes stakeholder engagement through public consultation and participation, the right to petition government, freedom of information legislation, rules on political parties and election campaign financing, codes of conduct for public officials and lobbyists, mechanisms for keeping regulatory and supervisory authorities accountable and effective provisions against illicit influencing.”
   
  -
    overview: |
        
        36. Local context – insofar as it is not contrary to the guiding principles, the lobbying regulations should address the particularities of the local context, including any socio-political considerations (such as presence of ‘corporatism’, or formalised social partnerships); the degree of informal and professional lobbying; and the nature of public concerns that potentially give rise to regulation. 
        
    notes: |
        Consideration of the **local context** is important to avoid schematic copy-paste solutions when drafting legislation. Any part of these Standards needs to fit the particularities of the country: Is it necessary to define the circle of lobbyists in a wider manner? Do we need more information through the lobbying register? What would be the proper title and terminology for the regulation in order to convey the right message? As an example, in some countries, the legislative process might already define how industry and labour associations participate; these associations might thus argue that there is no need for them to be included into a future lobbying regulation. In this regard, one has to review, to what extent their already existing participation complies with the transparency and ethics standards of a future lobbying regulation.[^78]

    overview: |
        
        37. Broader regulatory framework – the design of lobbying regulations necessitates a thorough review, consistency with and potential amendment of the broader regulatory framework, else the entirety of lobbying regulation may prove futile. This concerns in particular the laws and policies on:
        
            1. trading in influence, bribery and other corrupt conduct
            2. political finance (limits and transparency) and sponsoring of election candidates or parties
            3. public procurement and state benefits (due process and supervision mechanisms)
            4. media law (independence and sponsorship)

    notes: |
        1. **Bribery** is the most direct form of undue lobbying: the bribe giver seeks to influence a public official. All international conventions criminalise it.[^79] **Trading in influence** occurs when a person has real or apparent influence on the decision-making of a public official and exchanges this influence for an undue advantage. The offence thus targets not the decision-maker, but “those persons who are in the neighbourhood of power and [who] try to obtain advantages from their situation” by influencing the decision-maker.[^80] All international conventions criminalise the offence,[^81] but make it optional for member states to adopt it.
        
            > **Practical Example:** Lobbying registers can help to uncover instances of wrong-doing and hence trigger administrative or criminal investigations. For example, suspiciously high lobbying spending by one interest group might trigger an investigation into what extent the money was used for illegal political financing or bribery rather than lobbying (as was the case with the notorious U.S. lobbyist Jack Abramoff).
            
        2. Political finance rules need to be robust in order to avoid the possibility that donations to a political party would result in favourable access and treatment if they are elected into power, as this would be akin to acts of corruption.

            The following international standards are relevant in this context: Council of Europe’s Venice Commission and OSCE/ODIHR “Guidelines on political party regulation”;[^82] “Common Rules against Corruption in the Funding of Political Parties and Electoral Campaigns”.[^83]
            
        3. Undue influence through lobbying is a high risk where financial interests are involved. This concerns public procurement and other areas of state benefits.[^84] The OECD[^85] and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)[^86] set international standards on procurement.
        
        4. Lobbying can also include general “agenda-setting” activities. Media reports often do have an influence on public opinion and on public officials, but as long as media are reporting freely and independently, this is not technically lobbying. However, in practice some media outlets are owned by large interest groups that may have an influence on the editorial content of the media outlet. In the context of lobbying it is important to prohibit sponsoring of news broadcast or emissions on current political events,[^87] and it is essential to preserve the independence of the media from outside financial influences.[^88] General international standards[^89] support such regulations.

            The Council of Europe Parliamentary Resolution 1636 (2008) inter alia calls for journalists to “disclose to their viewers or readers any political and financial interests” and for media outlets to “have editorial independence from media owners”.[^90]
            
        5. **Labour unions** can be powerful interest groups and should not be exempt from lobbying regulations. Lobbying registration does not infringe on constitutional rights of collective bargaining, but in fact only makes it transparent.
        
        6. Whistle-blower protection is essential if insiders are to be able to securely report instances of possible misconduct. Reporting on violations of lobbying regulations should be explicitly included in the incidents protected by **whistle-blower** protection. The Council of Europe has adopted in 2014 the first international standard on this issue.[^91]
        
        7. As stated above in the section on Participation and Access, **legislative procedures** should be open and transparent from an early stage in order to permit public scrutiny and participation. The possibility of expedited legislative procedures should not be abused to reduce the possibilities for public input.
        
        8. **Judicial** and administrative **review** is important to ensure that an independent body can exercise control over the implementation of lobbying regulations and of the broader regulatory framework.
        
        9. Without these basic human rights, citizens would not be able to participate, and interest groups would not be able to form and to gather together to defend their interests, or “lobby” their decision-makers.
